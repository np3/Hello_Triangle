Hello Triangle Vulkan anti-aliasing demo
=========================

This is a traditional Hello World style application for graphical Vulkan.
It renders a RGB shaded equilateral triangle (well, if the resolution is a
square) with MSAA on.

The code is quite flat and basic, so I think it's good enough for learning. No
tutorial or even much comments are provided though (comments do lie anyway
:smirk:).

But I have tried not to cut corners making it. It contains proper error handling
and I assume it is without errors :innocent:. It should perfectly adhere to the
Vulkan specification &mdash; e.g. it should do proper synchronization and do so
in reasonably efficient way (as it was meant to be used). Well, at least that is
the goal (i.e to have at least for this elementary case a flawless enough
application).

Branches
-----------------

The git branches demonstrate some basic Vulkan features which can be easily
grafted on this basic example (it is nice to see a diff of what exactly needs to
be changed to make it work). Their `README.md` should be edited to reflect the
changes.

Proper renderloop synchronization mini-tutorial
-------------------------------------

Well, people tend to ask this one over and over, so I will make an exception to
the "no tutorial" policy above :wink::
[doc/synchronizationTutorial.md](doc/synchronizationTutorial.md).

Requirements
----------------------------

**OS**: Windows or Linux  
**Language**: C++14  
**Build environment**: (latest) LunarG SDK (requires `VULKAN_SDK` variable, and `glslc` binary built)  
**Build environment[Windows]**: Visual Studio, Cygwin, or MinGW (or IDEs running on top of them)  
**Build environment[Linux]**: g++ or clang (and compatible IDEs) and libxcb-dev and libxcb-keysyms-dev  
**Build Environment[GLFW]**: GLFW 3.2+ (already included as a git submodule), requires `xorg-dev` package on Linux  
**Build environment[Xlib]**: Requires `xorg-dev` package  
**Build environment[XCB]**: Requires `libxcb1-dev`, `libxcb-util-dev`, `libxcb-keysyms1-dev`, and `x11proto-dev` packages  
**Build environment[Wayland]**: Requires `libwayland-dev` and `libxkbcommon-dev` packages  
**Target Environment**: installed (latest) Vulkan capable drivers (to see anything)  
**Target Environment**: GLFW(recommended), XCB, Xlib, or Wayland based windowing system

On Unix-like environment refer to [SDK docs](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/sdk/latest/linux/getting_started.html) on how to set `VULKAN_SDK` variable.

Adding `VkSurface` support for other platforms should be straightforward using
the provided ones as a template for it.

Config
---------------------------------------

You can change the application configuration by simply changing following
variables in `HelloTriangle.cpp`.

| config variable | purpose | default |
|---|---|---|
| `debugVulkan` | Turns debug output and validation layers on | tries to choose based on compiler debug mode |
| `debugAmount` | Which kinds of debug messages will be shown | `WARNING` \| `PERFORMANCE_WARNING` \| `ERROR` |
| `fpsCounter` | Enable FPS counter via `VK_LAYER_LUNARG_monitor` layer | `true` |
| `initialWindowWidth` | The initial width of the rendered window | `800` |
| `initialWindowHeight` | The initial height of the rendered window | `800` |
| `presentMode` | The presentation mode of Vulkan used in swapchain | `VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_KHR` <sup>1</sup>|
| `clearColor` | Background color of the rendering | gray (`{0.1f, 0.1f, 0.1f, 1.0f}`) |
| `vertexShaderFilename` | The file with the SPIR-V vertex shader program | `triangle.vert.spv` |
| `fragmentShaderFilename` | The file with the SPIR-V fragment shader program | `triangle.frag.spv` |
| `sampleCount` | The desired sample count for the frame (as a Vulkan enum) |

<sup>1</sup> I preferred `VK_PRESENT_MODE_IMMEDIATE_KHR` before but it tends to
make coil whine because of the exteme FPS (which could be unnecessarily
dangerous to the PCB in long term).

Build
----------------------------------------------

First just get everything:

    $ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/krOoze/Hello_Triangle.git

In many platforms CMake style build should work just fine:

    $ cmake -G"Your preferred generator"

or even just

    $ cmake .

Then use `make`, or the generated Visual Studio `*.sln`, or whatever it created.

There are two cmake options (supplied by `-D`):
 - `WSI` -- set this to `USE_PLATFORM_GLFW` or any `VK_USE_PLATFORM_*_KHR` to
    select the WSI to be used. Default is GLFW.
 - `TODO` -- set this to `OFF` to remove TODO messages during compilation.

 You also might want to add `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`.

<hr />

The code base is quite simple and it can be built manually. It only assumes that
the `src` folder is in the include path, that you link the GLFW dependency, and
that you compile the GLSL shader files into SPIR-V.

In Visual Studio you can simply import the code and add things mentioned above.
Either "console" or "window" subsystem is a valid choice.

In Linux distro you would do e.g.:

    $ g++ --std=c++14 -Wall -m64 -D_DEBUG -DNO_TODO -I$VULKAN_SDK/include -I./src/ -o./HelloTriangle src/HelloTriangle.cpp -ldl -L$VULKAN_SDK/lib -lvulkan -lglfw

GLSL shaders can be compiled using `glslc` from LunarG Vulkan SDK like so:  
On Windows-like environment:

    %VULKAN_SDK%/Bin/glslc -mfmt=c -o ./src/shaders/hello_triangle.vert.spv.inl ./src/shaders/hello_triangle.vert
    %VULKAN_SDK%/Bin/glslc -mfmt=c -o ./src/shaders/hello_triangle.frag.spv.inl ./src/shaders/hello_triangle.frag

Or on Unix-like environment you would use just `$VULKAN_SDK` instead:

    $VULKAN_SDK/Bin/glslc -mfmt=c -o ./src/shaders/hello_triangle.vert.spv.inl ./src/shaders/hello_triangle.vert
    $VULKAN_SDK/Bin/glslc -mfmt=c -o ./src/shaders/hello_triangle.frag.spv.inl ./src/shaders/hello_triangle.frag

There are annoying (on purpose) TODOs generated on build. They can be disabled
by defining `NO_TODO` preprocessor macro.

Using GLFW is optional. You may choose another windowing platform by modifying
`VulkanEnvironment.h`. By default all platforms use GLFW.

Run
------------------------

You just run it as you would anything else.

<kbd>Esc</kbd> does terminate the app.  
<kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> toggles fullscreen (might not work on some WSI
platforms.
